# QEAP - Quick and Easy Application Persistence

QEAP is a Rust library that eliminates the boilerplate typically required for storing and loading application data to/from JSON files on disk. With just a few annotations, you can add persistent storage capabilities to any serializable Rust struct.

## Key Features

- Zero-boilerplate persistence: Simply derive Qeap on your structs and specify a storage directory
- Automatic file management: Creates directories and JSON files automatically
- Default initialization: If no saved data exists, loads using the struct's Default implementation
- Type-safe operations: Leverages Rust's type system and serde for reliable serialization/deserialization
- Comprehensive error handling: Detailed error types for initialization, file I/O, and JSON parsing operations
- Scoped operations: Advanced macro for automatic load/save cycles within function scopes

## How It Works

QEAP provides a derive macro that automatically implements persistence methods on your structs:

-  load(): Loads data from disk, creating a default instance if no file exists
-  save(&self): Saves the current instance to disk
-  file_path(): Returns the full path where the data is stored

The library automatically:
1. Creates the specified directory structure if it doesn't exist
2. Generates JSON filenames based on your struct's name (e.g., Config â†’ Config.json)
3. Handles the complete save/load lifecycle with proper error handling via the `scoped` macro

## Architecture

The project consists of two main crates:

- qeap: The main library providing the Qeap trait, load/save functionality, and error types
- qeap_macro: Procedural macros for the #[derive(Qeap)] and #[qeap::scoped]

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- Application configuration files
- User preferences and settings
- Cache data that needs persistence
- Simple data storage without database complexity
- Rapid prototyping with persistent state

This library is ideal for developers who want persistent storage with minimal setup - just add the derive macro and you're ready to go!

## How To Use
Add `qeap` and `serde` to your project.
```sh
cargo add qeap
cargo add serde -F derive
```

Derive `qeap::Qeap`, `serde::Serialize`, and `serde::Deserialize` on the type(s) you wish to manage, then specify the directory you wish the store your data in via the `qeap` attribute macro.
```rust
use qeap::Qeap;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use std::path::PathBuf;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Qeap)]
#[qeap(dir = app_dir())] // `dir` is required
struct Config {
    timeout_seconds: u16,
    port: u16,
    log_location: PathBuf,
}

fn app_dir() -> PathBuf {
    std::env::home_dir()
        .map(|d| d.join("my_app"))
        .expect("home directory exists")
}
```

Deriving `qeap::Qeap` adds some methods to your type, `load()` and `save(&self)` (among others). You can use these to initialize an instance of your type and save updates respectively.

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error> {
    let mut config = Config::load()?;

    config.port = 3000;
    config.save()?;
}
```

### `qeap::scoped`

`qeap::scoped` automates things even further. Annotate a function call with `qeap::scoped`, then specify immutable or mutable references to types that derive `qeap::Qeap` as the function arguments. The function is restructured to automatically load the specified data, pass it to your function as requested,
then save the data to disk.
The function must have a return type of `Result<T, E> where E: From<qeap::error::Error>`.

```rust
#[qeap::scoped]
fn update_port(config: &mut Config) -> qeap::QeapResult<()> {
    config.port = 8080;
}
```

The `update_port` function is expanded into this.
```rust
fn update_port() -> qeap::QeapResult<()> {
    fn update_port_inner(config: &mut Something) -> qeap::QeapResult<()> {
        config.port = 8080;
        Ok(())
    }
    let mut config: Something = qeap::Qeap::load()?;
    let result = update_port_inner(&mut config);
    qeap::Qeap::save(&config)?;
    return result;
}
```

In order to call this function, you would call it without passing arguments.

```rust
fn main() -> qeap::QeapResult<()> {
    update_port()?;
}
```

Calling a function declared with arguments and not passing any into it at the call site might seem a bit unsavory to a lot of people, and I would agree.
For those that don't care, you have the option to use this macro as described above. However, the `main` purpose of this macro is to annotate
the `main` method of your application, like so.

```rust
#[qeap::scoped]
fn main(config: &mut Config) -> qeap::QeapResult<()> {
    // do stuff with `config`
}
```

This generates a `main` method for your application that automatically loads the data you need at the start, then saves it right before the application exits.
